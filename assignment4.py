# name=input("Enter your name: ")
# age=input("Enter your age: ")
# print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

# Takes a sentence as input from the user.
# Prints the sentence in all uppercase and lowercase.
# Replaces all spaces with underscores.
# Removes leading and trailing whitespace.

# n=input()
# print(n.upper())
# print(n.lower())
# print(n.replace(" ","__"))
# print(n.strip())

#3.Character counter: write a program that:
# Asks the user for a string.
# Prints how many characters are in the string, excluding spaces.

# n=input()
# count=len(n.replace(" ","").replace('"',""))
# print(count)

#4. Escape sequence practice: Write a program that uses escape sequences to print the following output:

# Escape Sequence Practice

print("Hello")
print("\tWorld")       # \t gives a tab space
print("This is a backslash: \\")  # \\ prints a single backslash
