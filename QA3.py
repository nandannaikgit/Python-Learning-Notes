#Write a Python program to declare variables of all basic data types (int, float, string, bool) and print their type using type().

# a=10
# b=10.45
# c="nandan"
# bool=True
# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))
# print(type(c))
# print(type(bool))


# What will be the output of the following code?
x="10"
y=5
print(x* y)  #10 will print 5 times 


# Write a program to take your name and age as input and display them in the following format:
#     My name is <name> and I am <age> years old.


# name=input("Enter your name: ")
# age=input("Enter your age: ")
# print(f"my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")


# Take two numbers as input and print their sum, difference, product, and division

a=10
b=2

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)
